# Targeting RNA Structures to Discover Therapeutic Binding Motifs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression related Noncoding RNAs
**_Abstract_:** Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and is the most common primary tumor of the liver. This aggressive malignancy results as the third cause of cancer-related deaths each year. Despite extensive research and improvements in HCC treatment, the overall prognosis remains poor. Consequently, a better form of treatment or drug targeting is required for HCC. The concept of targeting non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) has emerged as a pinnacle foundation in the future of vaccine and drug design. A few principles dictate a RNA’s receptor suitability in therapeutics such as Lipinski’s Rule of 5, SHAPE reactivities, and positional entropy. The relevance of targeting ncRNA molecules is evident since their functions mediate several cellular processes such as transcription and translation. In HCC, many ncRNAs have been shown to get upregulated or downregulated leading to abnormal regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. This research aims at predicting potential therapeutic small molecules to target HCC-related ncRNAs and identifying therapeutic binding motifs between the receptor-ligand complexes. Upon preliminary ncRNA research and analysis, a total of 691 compounds were blindly docked each time to 10 miRNA molecules using PyRx. Overall, the ZINC2308577 compound had the best performance with the lowest binding energy and root mean square deviation. Multiple amine chains were also seen as a moiety structure between the well performing compounds, along with a few repeating methyl groups. Furthermore, RNA secondary structure motifs were found as the regions of interaction between the well performing compounds and majority of miRNA receptors.
